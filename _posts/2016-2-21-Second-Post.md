title: Second Test Blog Post
---

Testing to see how the site looks with multiple posts up.

This is `pretty` cool. Testing some `code` tags.

Some shell scripts:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:github/every-repository.git
$ cd every-repository
$ npm install && npm start
```
Pictures are cool too:
![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

While on my run yesterday I began thinking about what it actually takes to learn something, to
truly master a particular field of study. I started by trying to objectively measure my progress on
some technical things I've been working on. I looked at some paths I've taken to attain knowledge in certain
areas and realized they are almost all very winding, unpredictable, but thorough and rigorous. I then compared
this to the path a typical technical book urges you to take. Often it is very linear and tactfully thorough,
like a recipe book. I use the term `tactfully thorough` because many books only have you rip apart a problem to see
its internals and fundamentals at use if it goes together nicely with something used later in the text. The problem with this is you're only
*truly* experimenting inside a sandbox in which the boundaries are the author's wishes.

So who are these authors anyways? Often a book will be chosen due to some number of achievements and/or notoriety attributed to
the author, who more or less is someone who has *made it* in the field you are trying to. Don't get me wrong, there is certainly nothing
wrong with reading a book to gain information but what I've found is that often people treat a book like school. They only follow the curriculum,
or in this case, the outline of each chapter which in my opinion outlines the bare essentials at best. The author usually discloses what point $a$ is
and what accepted methods have yielded in a point $b$. The problem I have with this is that there is a lot more real estate in between $a$ and $b$ than
most instructive texts show.

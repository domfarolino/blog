The subject of binary trees provides a lot of variation, mainly in the number of ways in which they can be classified.
This in turn provides an array of inductive proofs that can be applied differently dependent on your input data. This
post is intended to cover some of the variations of binary trees and neat proofs relating to their number of nodes ($N$),
number of internal nodes ($I$), number of leaves ($L$), and height ($H$).

# Preface

Before we continue with the specifics of binary trees let's make sure we've got some accurate fundamental definitions.

### Height of a node:

> The height of a node is the length of the
> longest downward path from that node to a leaf.
> The height of the root is the height of the tree.

### Depth:

> The depth of a node is the number of edges from
> the node to the tree's root node. A root node will
> have a depth of 0.

Based off of these definitions, we can say the height is
the number of edges between a given node and its deepest
descendant. Trivial graph theory says if a path has $n$
edges then it has $n+1$ nodes, making the height of a tree
with $1$ node equal to $0$.

# Categories of Binary Trees

Often binary trees can be classified as at least one of the following:

 - Full (sometimes called proper or strictly) binary tree
 - Complete binary tree
 - Perfect binary tree

Full trees are given the following definition:
> a binary tree T is full if
> each node is either a leaf or
> possesses exactly two child nodes

This definition provides fairly loose restrictions on the tree allowing
it to take many shapes. One example of a full tree would be this:

![full binary tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-7-01-Binary-Tree-Inductive-Proofs/full.png)

Complete trees are given the following definition:
> a binary tree T with n
> levels is complete if all
> levels except possibly the
> last are completely full, and
> the last level has all its nodes
> to the left side

This definition is more strict than the
definition of a full tree, making all complete
trees, *also* full trees. One example of a complete
tree would be this:

![complete binary tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-7-01-Binary-Tree-Inductive-Proofs/complete.png)

Perfect trees are given the following definition:
> A perfect binary tree is a binary
> tree in which all interior nodes
> have two children and all leaves
> have the same depth or same level

This definition provides very rigid restrictions. This
means all perfect trees will be shaped like the following:

![perfect binary tree]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2016-7-01-Binary-Tree-Inductive-Proofs/perfect.png)

There is some hierarchy here. Full trees
have the loosest definition of them all and
as a result, any proof perfect tree is not only
perfect, but complete, and also full. Complete trees
are both complete and full. Full trees are just full, or
sometimes called "strictly" binary trees.

# Full Binary Tree Theorem

Since full trees have loosest restrictions put on them, just about
anything we prove for a full tree is automatically proved for a complete
and perfect tree so we'll start here with the **Full Binary Tree Theorem**.

Luckily for us, the restriction put on full binary trees (that all internal nodes
must have exactly two children) means that no matter what the shape of the tree is,
the relationships between the number of nodes $N$, leaves $L$, and internal nodes $I$
remain the same. The following proofs make up the **Full Binary Tree Theorem**.

## 1.) The number of leaves $L$ in a full binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes $I$

We can prove $L = I + 1$ by induction.

### Base case(s)

A tree with $0$ internal nodes has $1$ leaf node.
A tree with $1$ internal node has $2$ leaf nodes.
These base cases prove the theorem for $n = 0$ & $n = 1$.

### Inductive hypothesis

Let's assume that any full binary tree with $I$ internal nodes has $I+1$ leaves.

### Inductive step

Let $T$ be a full binary tree with $I+1$ internal nodes. $T$
has at least one internal node so it must have at least two leaves.
Select a leaf $v$ at maximal depth so that $v$'s sibling is also a leaf
at maximal depth. Remove $v$ and its sibling. The parent of $v$ and its sibling
was an internalnode but is now a leaf. The resulting tree is a full binary tree with
$I$ internal nodes which by the inductive hypothesis contains $L = I + 1$ leaves. Adding
$v$ and its sibling back to their parent makes their parent an internal node again increasing
the number of internal nodes from $I \Rightarrow I+1$ and the number of leaves from $I+1 \Rightarrow I+2$.
This clearly equals $(I + 1) + 1$ thus proving by induction that the number of leaves for any full binary tree
with $I$ internal nodes is $I+1 \quad \blacksquare$.

## 2.) The total number of nodes $N$ in a tree with $I$ internal nodes is $N = 2I + 1$

Using the previous proof, we know that the number of leaves in a tree with $I$
internal nodes is $I+1$, therefore the total number of nodes $N$ in a tree with $I$
internal nodes is $I + I + 2 = 2I + 1$.

We can also *prove* this by induction without using any other proofs.

### Base case(s)

A tree with $0$ internal nodes has $1$ node altogether.
A tree with $1$ internal node has $3$ nodes altogether.
Base case proves the theorem for $n = 0$ & $n = 1$.

### Inductive hypothesis

Let's assume that any full binary tree with $I$ internal nodes has $2I+1$ nodes

### Inductive step

Let $T$ be a full binary tree with $I+1$ internal nodes. $T$
has at least one internal node so it must have at least two leaves.
Select a leaf $v$ at maximal depth so that $v$'s sibling is also a leaf
at maximal depth. Remove $v$ and its sibling, and let $Tâ€²$ be the resulting
tree. The parent of $v$ and its sibling is an internal node in $T$ but a leaf
in $T'$. $T'$ is a full binary tree with $I$ internal nodes which by the inductive
hypothesis must contain $N = 2I + 1$ total nodes. Adding $v$ and $v$'s sibling back
to their parent gives us $I+1$ internal nodes and $(2I + 1) + 2 = 2I + 3$ total nodes
which clearly equals $2(I+1) + 1$.














# Perfect binary tree

## Relationship between $N$ and $H$ of a perfect binary tree

If we try and calculate how many nodes $N$ exist in a perfect binary tree of height
$H$ we can tabulate the following data:

$$
  \boxed{
    \begin{array}{c||cr}
      \text{Height } H & \text{Nodes } N \\\
      \hline
      0 & 1 \\\
      \hline
      1 & 3 \\\
      \hline
      2 & 7 \\\
      \hline
      3 & 15 \\\
    \end{array}
  }
$$

The mathematical relationship we can deduce between the number of nodes in a perfect tree $N$, and
it's height $H$ appears to be:

$$N = 2^{H+1} - 1$$

We can prove this relationship with induction.

### Base case

Trivial, a tree of height $0$ has $2^{0+1} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ node } \blacksquare$

### Assumption

Assume that for all perfect trees of height $H$, $N = 2^{H+1} - 1$.

### Inductive step

Prove that the formula works for a tree of height $H+1$, namely a tree of height $H+1$
should have $2^{H+2} - 1$ total nodes.

We can see that a tree of height $H+1$ will have $2^{H+1}$ more nodes (leaves) than a tree of
height $H$, meaning we can write the number of nodes of a tree of height $H+1$ in terms
of a tree with height $H$ as $2^{H+1} + 2^{H+1} - 1$.

$$
\begin{align}
      2^{H+2} - 1 \\\
      & = 2^{H+1} + 2^{H+1} - 1 \\\
      & = 2\cdot2^{H+1} - 1 \\\
      & = 2^{H+2} - 1 \quad \blacksquare \\\
  \end{align}
$$

This proof can also be done backwards solving for $H$ instead of $N$.

$$H = \log(N+1) - 1 \text{ where } \log \text{ is } \log_2$$

This is intuitive by looking at the table, as we can see at every level we are
one node short of making a perfect power of two. We add one ($N+1$), to create
this perfect power of two, then subtract one from $\log(N+1)$. This appears to
give us our height.

### Base case

A tree with $1$ node has a height of $\log(1+1) - 1 = 0$.

### Assumption

Assume that for a tree with $N$ nodes, $H = \log(N+1) - 1$.

### Inductive step

To get our perfect binary tree to the next height, we can make the observation
that we must add $N+1$ leaves to our current $N$ nodes. This is part of our inductive
hypothesis and we now need to prove that a tree with $N + (N + 1)$ nodes has a height
of $H+1$ or $log(N+1)$.

$$
\begin{align}
      H+1 \\\
      & = \log(N + 1 + N + 1) - 1 \\\
      & = \log(2n + 2) - 1 \\\
      & = \log(2(n + 1)) - 1 \\\
      & = \log(2) + \log(n+1) - 1 \\\
      & = 1 + \log(n+1) - 1 \\\
      & = 1 + H \quad \blacksquare \\\
  \end{align}
$$

## Relationship between $N$ and $L$ of a perfect binary tree

All binary trees have two types of nodes, internal nodes and leaves. Internal
nodes parent at least $1$ child. In perfect binary trees, internal nodes must
parent exactly $2$ children. Leaves are nodes which have exactly $0$ children.

If we try and calculate how many nodes $L$ exist in a perfect binary tree of size
$N$ we can tabulate the following data:

$$
  \boxed{
    \begin{array}{c|c}
      \text{Nodes } N & \text{Leaves } L \\\
      \hline
      1 & 1 \\\
      \hline
      3 & 2\\\
      \hline
      7 & 4\\\
      \hline
      15 & 8\\\
    \end{array}
  }
$$

The mathematical relationship we can deduce between the number of nodes in a perfect tree $N$, and
the number of leaves $L$ appears to be:

$$L = \frac{N+1}{2}$$

This means the number of leaves grows linearly with the number of total nodes. Let's prove this by induction.

## Base case

A tree with $1$ node has $\frac{1+1}{2} = 1$ leaf node.

## Assumption

Let's assume that the equation $L = \frac{N+1}{2}$ is true for all perfect trees with $N$ nodes.

## Inductive step

We can see see that the number of leaves double every time we add a new level, so we need to prove
that the number of leaves is $2L$ when we add $N+1$ nodes to our current tree.

$$
\begin{align}
      2L \\\
      & = \frac{N + 1 + N + 1}{2} \\\
      & = \frac{2(N + 1)}{2} \\\
      & = N + 1 \\\
      & = 2L \quad \blacksquare \\\
  \end{align}
$$

## Relationship between $H$ and $L$ of a perfect binary tree

This is by far the simplest and most intuitive of the proofs we'll go over. From the other
tables you've probably noticed the number of leaves double from height to height. Further,
the mathematical relationship we can deduce between the height $H$ and number of leaves $L$ is
$L = 2^H$. Let's prove it by induction.

## Base case

A tree of height $0$ should only have $1$ leafe node. $L = 2^0 = 1$.

## Assumption

Let's assume that at height $H$, a perfect binary tree will have $2^H$ leaf nodes.

## Inductive step

Prove that at height $H+1$, a perfect binary tree will have double its current leaves, or $2^{H+1}$.
Since the proof is basically just asking us to prove that $2^{H+1}$ is double $2^H$ all we have to
establish is:

$$2(2^H) = 2^{H+1} \quad \blacksquare$$

I'm currently a 4th year computer science major at the University of Cincinnati and a Software Engineering
intern at Mozilla. Most of my programming experience comes from outside school. I'm very passionate about
the web, algorithms, and math. I also like writing web applications and contributing to web standards.

### More Information

In my free time I love to play the piano (mostly Mozart) but I've also written some music myself. As
stated before, I love to do math and solve algorithms on my own time, as solving interesting problems
just generally makes me feel good! I love running, racquetball, and hate spiders ðŸ˜Š.

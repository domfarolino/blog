I'm a 4th year computer science major at the University of Cincinnati, Software Engineering intern
at Microsoft, Chromium contributer, and ex-Mozilla intern. I'm very passionate about the web platform,
algorithms, and mathematics. I'm a member of the [WHATWG](https://github.com/whatwg/), technical owner
of the [Priority Hints API](https://wicg.github.io/priority-hints/) implementation in Chromium, and editor
of the [Console Standard](https://console.spec.whatwg.org/).

### More Information

In my free time I love to play the piano (mostly Mozart) but I've also written some music myself. As
stated before, I love to do math and solve algorithms on my own time. I love running, racquetball, and
hate spiders ðŸ˜Š.

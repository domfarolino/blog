I'm currently a sophomore at the University of Cincinnati studying computer science. Most of my programming experience comes from outside school. I'm very
passionate about the web and its impact on our future. I love to build things, study math and algorithms, and write web applications.

### More Information

In my free time I love to play the piano (mostly Mozart) but I've also written some music myself. As stated before, I love to do math and solve algorithms
on my own time, as solving interesting problems just generally makes me feel good! I love running, racquetball, and hate spiders ðŸ˜Š
